* I wanted to create a website linked to a database, which allows users to log in, search for, and find printers and cartridges for them.
* Currently, I have a basic one-page website, and I think it's a time to upgrade to bring more customers in, and be able to manage production more easily
* I wanted to be able to add, edit and delete items of products for sale.
